# pacman-agent
Implementation of agents that control Ms PacMan.

This repository consists of 2 different agents that control Ms PacMan, a framework which is based on a competition from <a href="http://www.pacmanvghosts.co.uk/index.html">this</a> link. In this project, a Behavior Tree and a Finite State Machine were implemented that return in every instance the move command for Ms PacMan. The agents follow the Partial Observability Rule, a rule that indicates that Ms PacMan can only have access to a part of the space she moves.
